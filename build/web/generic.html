                                    <p>This article reviews the different definitions of Corporate Social Responsibility 
(CSR) and Corporate Sustainability (CS) used over time to reveal points of difference 
and congruence between the two terms.  Management literature uses both CSR and CS to 
refer to social and environmental management issues, but there is no clear distinction 
between the two terms.  First, I quantify the articles published about CSR and CS in both 
general management and specialized journals.  Second, I summarize the different CSR 
and CS- related definitions to identify the definitional differences between CSR and CS.  
Finally, I identify opportunities to reshape a rapidly changing field by enhancing 
collaboration between scholars devoted to studying CSR and CS issues.</p>

					<p>Regarding corporate sustainability, some scholars identify CS as simply one 
approach to conceptualizing CSR, or vice versa.  For example, Garriga and Melé (2004) 
recently tried to map the CSR territory and they listed ―sustainable development‖ as one 
of several theories and approaches used to conceptualize CSR.  Interestingly, they also 
list CSP, corporate citizenship, issues management, and cause-related marketing as 
alternative approaches.  This evidences the variety of constructs and approaches used 
within the CSR territory.</p>
